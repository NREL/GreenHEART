# Installing GreenHeart

```bash
pip install greenheart
```

## NREL Resource Data

1. The functions which download resource data require an NREL API key. Obtain a key from:

    [https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/](https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/)

2. To set up the `NREL_API_KEY` and `NREL_API_EMAIL` required for resource downloads, you can create
   Environment Variables called `NREL_API_KEY` and `NREL_API_EMAIL`. Otherwise, you can keep the key
   in a new file called ".env" in the root directory of this project.

    Create a file ".env" that contains the single line:

    ```bash
    NREL_API_KEY=key
    NREL_API_EMAIL=your.name@email.com
    ```

## Installing from Source

For most use cases, installing from source will be the preferred installation route.

### NREL-Provided Conda Environment Specification (recommended)

1. Using Git, navigate to a local target directory and clone repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NREL/GreenHEART.git
    ```

2. Navigate to `GreenHEART`

    ```bash
    cd GreenHEART
    ```

3. (Optional) If using NREL resource data, you will need an NREL API key, which can be obtined from:
    [https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/](https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/)

    1. In `environment.yml`, add the following lines to the bottom of the file, and replace the
       items in angle brackets (`<>`), including the brackets with your information. Be sure that
       "variables" has no leading spaces

        ```yaml
        variables:
          NREL_API_KEY=<API-KEY>
          NREL_API_EMAIL=<email-address>
        ```

4. Create a conda environment and install GreenHEART and all its dependencies

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

5. Install Cbc.
   1. If using a Unix machine (not Windows), install a final dependency

        ```bash
        conda install -y -c conda-forge coin-or-cbc=2.10.8
        ```
    
    2. Windows users will have to manually install Cbc: https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc

An additional step can be added if additional dependencies are required, or you plan to use this
environment for development work.

- Pass `-e` for an editable developer install
- Use one of the extra flags as needed:
  - `examples`: allows you to use the Jupyter Notebooks
  - `develop`: adds developer and documentation tools
  - `all` simplifies adding all the dependencies

This looks like the following for a developer installation:

```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

### Manual steps

1. Using Git, navigate to a local target directory and clone repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NREL/GreenHEART.git
    ```

2. Navigate to `GreenHEART`

    ```bash
    cd GreenHEART
    ```

3. Create a new virtual environment and change to it. Using Conda Python 3.11 (choose your favorite
   supported version) and naming it 'greenheart' (choose your desired name):

    ```bash
    conda create --name greenheart python=3.11 -y
    conda activate greenheart
    ```

4. Install GreenHEART and its dependencies:

    ```bash
    conda install -y -c conda-forge glpk
    pip install electrolyzer@git+https://github.com/jaredthomas68/electrolyzer.git@smoothing
    pip install ProFAST@git+https://github.com/NREL/ProFAST.git
    ```

    ````{note}
    Unix users should install Cbc via:

    ```bash
    conda install -y -c conda-forge coin-or-cbc=2.10.8
    ```

    Windows users should install Cbc manually according to https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc.
    ````

    - If you want to just use GreenHEART:

       ```bash
       pip install .  
       ```

    - If you want to work with the examples:

       ```bash
       pip install ".[examples]"
       ```

    - If you also want development dependencies for running tests and building docs:  

       ```bash
       pip install -e ".[develop]"
       ```

    - In one step, all dependencies can be installed as:

      ```bash
      pip install -e ".[all]"
      ```
